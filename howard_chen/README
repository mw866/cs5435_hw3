Strategy for generate_from_empty.py:
- loop through the input real passwords
- seperate them into 3 categories: char, digit, special
- with some randomness, lower/upper case the character
- with some randomness, substitute the digit with random digit
- shuffle each block
- shuffle block position
- if sweetword exists in the generated set or equal to real password,
  run the same procedure again
