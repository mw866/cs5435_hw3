Description: A Python program that generates the "honeywords" proposed in  
"Honeywords: Making Password-Cracking Detectable," by Ari Juels and Ronald L. Rivest  http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/honeywords/

## Instructions

Due to the Github size restriction, please first unzip the full.zip to extract full.txt (Full RockYou records) .

Run the following python files:

**gen_1.py**: 1. T is the empty set, i.e., the algorithm uses no example passwords.

**gen_2.py**: 2. T is the set of the 100 most common RockYou passwords.

**gen_3.py**: 3. T is the full RockYou dataset

## Attempts
* frequency analysis
* character position based syntax
* dropping action 1 (random character)
* name recognition
* dictionary strategy for similar words
* names vs places
